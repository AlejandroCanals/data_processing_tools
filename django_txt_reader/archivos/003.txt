The 2016 Ford Escape has exceeded my expectations. The dealership was incredibly professional and helped me get a great deal on the vehicle. They were transparent about the pricing and financing options. I've been driving the Escape for about a year, and it has been a joy to own. The SUV is spacious, reliable, and perfect for my family trips. Couldn't be happier with my purchase!
